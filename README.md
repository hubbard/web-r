This repository contains several example R scripts to help me quickly remember how to do certain things.  
Something that seems like it should be simple, might actually require several steps and archane commands.  For example, 
time-series-linear-regression.r details the steps required to do a time-series linear regression, which is a little
more complex than you might think.

Let me know if you'd like to add or modify these to make even more useful.
